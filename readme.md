## Usage
0. Install python3
1. Download `modsaber.py`
2. Run it

Alternatively:
1. Download a binary from the release tab
2. Run that

## Why?
Because installing a 45MB app that just downloads files and extracts them is insane.

## Why not?
No support for Oculus. (add it yourself)
No support in general.
